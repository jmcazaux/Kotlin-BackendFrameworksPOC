# Experimenting with Kotling backend frameworks

The goal is to play a bit with the most used frameworks when developping an API with Kotlin.
The end goal is to produce a very small application, but... Trying to compile it to a native executable (GraalVM).

The small app is derived from a LinkedIn learning course [here](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-spring-with-spring-boot-13886371).
